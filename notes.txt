# Install and setup Rust environment in Linux

# Download the Rust installation script from rustup.rs (official Rust installation tool) 
# using curl with silent, show-error, and fail flags. 
# The script is then piped into 'sh' to execute it.
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

# Load the Rust environment variables into the current shell session 
# by sourcing the cargo environment script.
# This allows the use of Rust-related tools (cargo, rustc, etc.) without restarting the shell.
